# Admin Authentication Testing Guide

## Overview
The admin routes are now protected and require authentication. Only authenticated admin users can access `/admin` and `/admin/*` routes.

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Accessing Admin Routes
- **Without Authentication**: Users will be redirected to `/admin/login`
- **With Authentication**: Users can access admin dashboard and all admin features

### 2. Admin Login
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5174/admin/login`
- **Access**: Navigate directly to the URL (admin login is not prominently displayed on the public website for security reasons)

### 3. Test Credentials
For testing purposes, you can use any email/password combination as the authentication is currently mocked.

Example:
- **Email**: `admin@kalyani.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`

### 4. Protected Routes
All these routes now require admin authentication:
- `/admin` - Admin Dashboard
- `/admin/branches` - Branch Management
- `/admin/products` - Product Management
- `/admin/categories` - Category Management
- `/admin/metals` - Metal Management
- `/admin/gems` - Gem Management
- `/admin/requests` - Service Requests
- `/admin/users` - User Management
- `/admin/reviews` - Review Management

### 5. Testing Steps

1. **Test Unauthorized Access**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5174/admin`
   - Should redirect to `/admin/login`

2. **Test Login**:
   - Enter any email/password
   - Should redirect to admin dashboard after successful login

3. **Test Protected Routes**:
   - Try accessing any admin sub-route directly
   - Should redirect to login if not authenticated

4. **Test Logout**:
   - Click the user menu in admin header
   - Click "Logout"
   - Should redirect to home page

### 6. Features Implemented

✅ **Authentication Context**: Manages user state across the app
✅ **Protected Routes**: Admin routes are protected with authentication
✅ **Login Form**: Real authentication form with loading states
✅ **User Display**: Shows authenticated user info in admin header
✅ **Logout Functionality**: Proper logout with token cleanup
✅ **Redirect Handling**: Redirects to intended page after login
✅ **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during auth operations
✅ **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate error messages

### 7. Integration with Backend

The authentication system is ready to integrate with your backend:
- Uses `apiClient.login()` method
- Stores JWT tokens in localStorage
- Includes Authorization headers in API requests
- Handles token expiration and cleanup

### 8. Security Features

- Route-level protection
- Token-based authentication
- Automatic redirect on unauthorized access
- Session management
- Secure logout with token cleanup

## Notes

- The current implementation uses mock authentication for testing
- In production, replace the mock user creation with real backend integration
- The authentication context is available throughout the app via `useAuth()` hook
- All admin routes are now properly protected
